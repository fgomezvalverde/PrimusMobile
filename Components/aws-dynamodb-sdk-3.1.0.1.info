{"Name":"AWSSDK - Amazon DynamoDB","Id":2025,"Alias":"aws-dynamodb-sdk","Description":"# Amazon DynamoDB\r\n \r\n\r\n**Overview**\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis is the Amazon DynamoDB API Reference. This guide provides descriptions and samples of the low-level DynamoDB API. For information about DynamoDB application development, see the [Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInstead of making the requests to the low-level DynamoDB API directly from your application, we recommend that you use the AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs). The easy-to-use libraries in the AWS SDKs make it unnecessary to call the low-level DynamoDB API directly from your application. The libraries take care of request authentication, serialization, and connection management. For more information, see [Using the AWS SDKs with DynamoDB](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/UsingAWSSDK.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you decide to code against the low-level DynamoDB API directly, you will need to write the necessary code to authenticate your requests. For more information on signing your requests, see [Using the DynamoDB API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/API.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe following are short descriptions of each low-level API action, organized by function.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Managing Tables**\r\n\r\n \r\n- *CreateTable* - Creates a table with user-specified provisioned throughput settings. You must designate one attribute as the hash primary key for the table; you can optionally designate a second attribute as the range primary key. DynamoDB creates indexes on these key attributes for fast data access. Optionally, you can create one or more secondary indexes, which provide fast data access using non-key attributes.\r\n- *DescribeTable* - Returns metadata for a table, such as table size, status, and index information.\r\n- *UpdateTable* - Modifies the provisioned throughput settings for a table. Optionally, you can modify the provisioned throughput settings for global secondary indexes on the table.\r\n- *ListTables* - Returns a list of all tables associated with the current AWS account and endpoint.\r\n- *DeleteTable* - Deletes a table and all of its indexes.\r\n \r\n\r\nFor conceptual information about managing tables, see [Working with Tables](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Reading Data**\r\n\r\n \r\n- *GetItem* - Returns a set of attributes for the item that has a given primary key. By default, *GetItem* performs an eventually consistent read; however, applications can request a strongly consistent read instead.\r\n- *BatchGetItem* - Performs multiple *GetItem* requests for data items using their primary keys, from one table or multiple tables. The response from *BatchGetItem* has a size limit of 16 MB and returns a maximum of 100 items. Both eventually consistent and strongly consistent reads can be used.\r\n- *Query* - Returns one or more items from a table or a secondary index. You must provide a specific hash key value. You can narrow the scope of the query using comparison operators against a range key value, or on the index key. *Query* supports either eventual or strong consistency. A single response has a size limit of 1 MB.\r\n- *Scan* - Reads every item in a table; the result set is eventually consistent. You can limit the number of items returned by filtering the data attributes, using conditional expressions. *Scan* can be used to enable ad-hoc querying of a table against non-key attributes; however, since this is a full table scan without using an index, *Scan* should not be used for any application query use case that requires predictable performance.\r\n \r\n\r\nFor conceptual information about reading data, see [Working with Items](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html) and [Query and Scan Operations](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/QueryAndScan.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Modifying Data**\r\n\r\n \r\n- *PutItem* - Creates a new item, or replaces an existing item with a new item (including all the attributes). By default, if an item in the table already exists with the same primary key, the new item completely replaces the existing item. You can use conditional operators to replace an item only if its attribute values match certain conditions, or to insert a new item only if that item doesn\u0027t already exist.\r\n- *UpdateItem* - Modifies the attributes of an existing item. You can also use conditional operators to perform an update only if the item\u0027s attribute values match certain conditions.\r\n- *DeleteItem* - Deletes an item in a table by primary key. You can use conditional operators to perform a delete an item only if the item\u0027s attribute values match certain conditions.\r\n- *BatchWriteItem* - Performs multiple *PutItem* and *DeleteItem* requests across multiple tables in a single request. A failure of any request(s) in the batch will not cause the entire *BatchWriteItem* operation to fail. Supports batches of up to 25 items to put or delete, with a maximum total request size of 16 MB.\r\n \r\n\r\nFor conceptual information about modifying data, see [Working with Items](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html) and [Query and Scan Operations](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/QueryAndScan.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### AWS Mobile SDK for Xamarin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe AWS Mobile SDK for Xamarin provides a set of .NET libraries, code samples, and documentation to help developers build connected mobile applications for iOS, Android, Windows 8, and Windows Phone devices. Mobile apps written using Xamarin call native platform APIs so they have the look and feel of native applications. The .NET libraries in the SDK provide C# wrappers around the AWS REST API implemented by AWS services.","Version":"3.1.0.1","Summary":"AWS DynamoDB SDK for Xamarin","QuickStart":"If you’re new to the AWS SDK for .Net/Xamarin, you’ll probably want to look first at [Getting Started with the AWS SDK for .NET/Xamarin](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforxamarin/developerguide/) which explains how to set up the SDK and how to get started using AWS Services from an Xamarin application.\r\n\r\nAfter you’ve set up the SDK, you can start working with the mobile clients for Amazon Web Services. The mobile clients are described in the service-specific topics. No matter which services you’re using, you should provide AWS credentials to your app via Amazon Cognito. The Amazon Cognito credentials provider is discussed briefly in the various mobile service topics, and at length in the [Amazon Cognito Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/devguide/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources\r\n\r\n- [**Xamarin Developer Guide**](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforxamarin/developerguide/) - For in-depth getting started and usage information\r\n- [**Code Sample**](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-net-samples) - Repository of example projects using the SDK.\r\n- [**AWS Mobile Forum**](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=88) – Ask questions, get help, and give feedback\r\n- [**API Reference**](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/latest/apidocs/Index.html) - For operations, parameters, responses, and examples\r\n- [**AWS Mobile Developer Blog**](http://mobile.awsblog.com/) - For updates and guidance on using the AWS SDK for Xamarin\r\n- [**Release Notes**](https://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/.NET) - To see the latest features, bug fixes, and changes in the SDK\r\n- [**Issues**](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues)  - Report issues and submit pull requests\r\n- [**@awsformobile**](https://twitter.com/awsformobile) - Follow us on Twitter","Hash":"000c898e0f4fd70593092f13eda064b3","TargetPlatforms":["ios","ios-unified","android"],"TrialHash":null}
